This project is a part of my learning process with Selenium WebDriver using the Java programming language, aimed at building automation testing skills. This mini project focuses on testing web applications and gaining hands-on experience with automation tools, utilizing a hybrid automation framework that incorporates Selenium, Java, JUnit, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. Additionally, it integrates the Cucumber framework to implement behavior-driven development (BDD), enabling the creation of feature files written in Gherkin syntax for more collaborative and user-friendly test cases. This comprehensive approach prepares me for a career as a software tester by mastering a variety of tools and frameworks essential for modern test automation.
